# slack

We use Slack for the bulk of our collaboration.  Come join us at samsung-cnct.slack.com

## channel guidelines

The goal here isn't to enforce strict rigid rules, but to codify 80% of what we use slack for with preventing the other 20%.

1. We use prefixes to denote long-term channels as "official"
  - `cnct`-prefixed channels for cnct-specific chat
  - `team`-prefixed channels for long-term project / engagement teams
  - `proj`-prefixed channels for short-term project / engagements
  - `ping`-prefixed channels for notifications
  - `meet`-prefixed channels for backchannel / offline chat during recurring meetings
  - `office`-prefixed channels for office-specific chat and administrivia
2. All else is permitted and considered one-off
  - You don't have to think about prefixes when making a channel, just make it
  - We regularly archive or add prefixes to long-lived channels via monthly curation

## curation guideliens

1. Nominate someone to curate monthly (@spiffxp)
2. Curator asks for someone to vouch for a channel if it's been inactive for a month
3. If nobody vouches for a channel, it gets archived (archived, _not_ deleted, data is sacred, keep it around)
4. If the channel's been around for two months, curator gives it a prefix 
5. Curator does this manually to understand the complications and challenges once or twice
6. Automate as much of this as possible, eg: aging out channels to archive after N weeks of inactivity

## known issues

- we have no guidelines on how to actually slack, you just sorta figure it out
- we run a few other slack instances; add guidelines for them? shut them down and invite folks over to our instance as guests?
