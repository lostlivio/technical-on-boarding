# community meetings

We participate in a number of reoccurring meetings in the open source community.  We primarily focus on meetings in the Kubernetes community.

## meeting guidelines

- meetings we lead/own (currently: sig-scalability, sig-testing) will have a primary owner who is responsible for setting up the meeting agenda and running the meeting
- meetings we care about will have a primary attendee who is responsible for attending, or finding someone to attend in their place
- everyone is encouraged but not required to attend the kubernetes-community meeting
- during the meeting, the attendee(s) post notes in the #meet-opensource slack channel, either via a link to .md file, or just straight chat
- we will have a weekly summary of community activity based on meeting notes / attendance
